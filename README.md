# Outdoors üèî
This is a fun little project for me to get familiar with SwiftUI, a user interface framework created by Apple. Apple states that this new UI framework allows developers to develop "better apps for less code". To learn more, visit the link below.

## Getting Started

This app is written in Swift 5.1 in the Xcode 12 IDE. No aditional installations are required to successfully build the app. Note that the UI has only been optimized for iPhone 11 / iPhone 12 running iOS 14.

## About

The Outdoors app showcases beautiful landmarks familiar to the people living in the British Columbia / Alberta area of Canada. This app features a beautiful home page that showcases said landmarks, but can be toggled to a list view that shows all the landmarks. Aditionally, users can mark landmarks of their choosing as their "favourites" in the list view and can sort out the list view based on their favourites. Each landmark page includes a photo, a description, and a map view of the area. Lastly, users have their own personal profile card that displays their achievements (known as badges), goal dates, and recent hikes data.

## What I Learned

I learned quite a bit regarding SwiftUI when developing this app. The whole process is streamlined for developers so that they focus on actually designing UI rather than looking for syntax errors, which is a common occurence for extremly wordy user interface frameworks. I'm pretty happy with my experience regarding SwiftUI and I will definitely incorporate it in my next projects when it comes to iOS apps.

## What can be improved?

Although this whole project is predominantely focused on UI only, I would love to see this app become a fully-pledged app. Some ideas of mine include:

1. A database system for the .json files that auto-updates, meaning aditional data does not need to be manually added.
2. A server system that includes user sign in that saves user data such as recent hikes, achievements, etc.
3. Dynamic photos that showcases the landmarks during different times of the year. (e.g. Lake Louise in the winter looks different than Lake Louise in the summer).
